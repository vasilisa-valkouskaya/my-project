                    <p>This class is designed for first time yogis. It's the right class for you if you want to learn the fundamentals of yoga in a group where everyone is new. The teacher will give you some background on yoga while you're seated, but come
                        prepared to move. You’ll walk out feeling embodied, empowered, energized, and eager to come back.</p>

                        as well as more advanced yogis who want to work on beginning poses.</p>

                        movement with some support—from seniors to pregnant women to world-class athletes.</p>
